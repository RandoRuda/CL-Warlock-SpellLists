# Compatibility Framework Warlock SpellList Example Mod

This is a Compatibility Framework Example Mod showing how to add spells to several spell lists.

This mod takes inspiration from the [OneDND Playerâ€™s Handbook Playtest 7 ](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ua/ph-playtest-7) which adds additional spells to the Warlock Spell List.

## Notes
- This code is not optimised in order to make sure it is readable by modders with less coding/scripting experience. We hope to add some more simplified functions down the line, wherein this will also be updated.
- Some class spell lists require lower level spells also be added to the higher level lists as well.
- Some subclasses have their own spell lists, requiring the spell needing to be added for each subclass individually.
- This mod adds two Level 1 spells to the Warlock spell lists:
    - Speak With Animals
    - Bane

| Magic Initiate| Spell Level 1 | Spell Level 1 | Spell Level 1 |
| Scroll List   | Spell Level 2 | Spell Level 2 | Spell Level 2 |
|               | Spell Level 3 | Spell Level 3 | Spell Level 3 |

|               | Spell Level 5 | Spell Level 5 | Spell Level 5 |


# Compatibility Framework

The Compatibility Framework provides an API for other mods to use improve compatibility. Initially designed for Subclass Compatibility, the Framework has API endpoints that Script-Extender Enabled mods can hook into to insert values into Progressions and Spell/Skill/PassiveLists at Runtime. What this means is that a mod author can inject their mod's data into existing Progressions or Lists without overwriting data, allowing for total compatibility. If you want to know which subclasses are currently supported, [check out this list](https://github.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Subclass-Compatibility-Framework/wiki/Supported-Mods).
